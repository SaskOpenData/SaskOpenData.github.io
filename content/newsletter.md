# Open data for the flatlands

In our modern time, we have the ability to connect citizens, business and government like never before. We cannot expect government to guess at what we in want or need out of our information infrastructure and we cannot expect them to do it on their own.

Through this newsletter, I'll keep you up-to-date with my progress on the Open Data Saskatchewan project and highlight developments in information transparency as they arise. It'd be great to have you along for this journey!
